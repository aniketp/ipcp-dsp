% Expected Outcomes

The expected outcome would be an exhaustive analysis of all prefetching algorithms against the provided
traces by the organizing commitee, as well some of our custom prepared traces using \textit{Pin}.

We would also try to come up with an optimal duelling prefetcher scheme by selecting the best prefetcher for an \
optimal sliding window of instructions or an instruction pointer. \\

\textbf{Stretch Goal:} Study prefetching techniques for Database-centric architectures 
\cite{asmdb} and derive some insights as to how some of the unneccesary code misses in LLC can be reduced.
