% Expected Outcomes

The expected outcome would be an exhaustive analysis of all prefetching algorithms against the provided
traces by the organizing commitee, as well some traces created by us.

\noindent We would try to understand the differences in results and causes of misperformance of certain algorithms
against various traces.
