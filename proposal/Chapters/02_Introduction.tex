% Introduction

In this project, we aim to evaluate and contrast all the submissions of the \textbf{3rd Data Prefetching
Championship} (DPC3). This will serve as a starting point for any future work (beyond the course) that we intend to 
do by identifying the key differences in all techniques. We aim to get necessary insights from the 
performance of various prefetching algorithms to aid us in our own research.
